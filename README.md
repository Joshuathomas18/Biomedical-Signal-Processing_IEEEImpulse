# Introduction

Biomedical signal processing refers to the application of techniques and algorithms to analyze physiological signals from the human body, such as ECG,
EEG, EMG, and others. In an era where healthcare moves to a more datadriven approach, biomedical signal processing can play an important role in
extracting meaningful information from such data. This field aims to convert
such raw physiological signals to concrete insights and get an actionable diagnosis. It not only enhances clinical decision-making but also supports the
development of new medical technologies, offering the potential for real-time
health monitoring, early detection of diseases, and remote patient care.
For the final round of Impulse 2025, the participants are challenged to develop a robust model for classifying Electroencephalogram (EEG) seizure types
from signals. Adding to it, an important aspect of it is to implement explainability techniques, promoting clinical trust in a hospital setting. The problem
statement derives its motivation from the critical role of EEG in neurology,
helping in diagnosing and managing neurological disorders. Manual EEG interpretation requires skill and is subjective. The integration of machine learning
with explainability will make a practical and clinically accurate tool ready for
use.
A primary useful feature of an EEG model is to segregate seizure-containing
EEGs to normal ones and secondly, in the latter, to demarcate seizure specific
regions and further classify seizure type, which helps neurologists establish a
diagnosis quickly and effectively. Videographic seizure detection provides another layer of usefulness, catching rare seizures not reflected on EEGs and hence,
improving the robustness of an EEG ML model.
 ## Task 1:
 In the field of biomedical signal processing, raw EEG signals often require initial preprocessing and feature extraction to understand and model underlying
patterns for classification tasks. The first step in this process is to visualize
the EEG data and compute basic statistical metrics that provide foundational
insights into the signal characteristics. These metrics, derived from the time
2
domain, help identify potential signal patterns that can serve as features for
machine learning models in future classification tasks.
