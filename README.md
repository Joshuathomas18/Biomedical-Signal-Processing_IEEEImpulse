# Introduction

Biomedical signal processing refers to the application of techniques and algorithms to analyze physiological signals from the human body, such as ECG,
EEG, EMG, and others. In an era where healthcare moves to a more datadriven approach, biomedical signal processing can play an important role in
extracting meaningful information from such data. This field aims to convert
such raw physiological signals to concrete insights and get an actionable diagnosis. It not only enhances clinical decision-making but also supports the
development of new medical technologies, offering the potential for real-time
health monitoring, early detection of diseases, and remote patient care.
For the final round of Impulse 2025, the participants are challenged to develop a robust model for classifying Electroencephalogram (EEG) seizure types
from signals. Adding to it, an important aspect of it is to implement explainability techniques, promoting clinical trust in a hospital setting. The problem
statement derives its motivation from the critical role of EEG in neurology,
helping in diagnosing and managing neurological disorders. Manual EEG interpretation requires skill and is subjective. The integration of machine learning
with explainability will make a practical and clinically accurate tool ready for
use.
A primary useful feature of an EEG model is to segregate seizure-containing
EEGs to normal ones and secondly, in the latter, to demarcate seizure specific
regions and further classify seizure type, which helps neurologists establish a
diagnosis quickly and effectively. Videographic seizure detection provides another layer of usefulness, catching rare seizures not reflected on EEGs and hence,
improving the robustness of an EEG ML model.
 ## Task 1:
 In the field of biomedical signal processing, raw EEG signals often require initial preprocessing and feature extraction to understand and model underlying
patterns for classification tasks. The first step in this process is to visualize
the EEG data and compute basic statistical metrics that provide foundational
insights into the signal characteristics. These metrics, derived from the time
2
domain, help identify potential signal patterns that can serve as features for
machine learning models in future classification tasks.

5 Extracting Frequency Domain Features
In this task, you will extract frequency-based features from the EEG signals.
These features provide valuable insights into the signal’s frequency content,
which is critical for understanding brain activity and for classification tasks in
biomedical signal processing. The Fourier Transform is a mathematical technique that converts a signal from its time-domain representation into the frequency domain. It breaks down a time-series signal into its constituent sinusoidal components (sines and cosines), revealing the different frequencies present
within the signal.
Another technique is Wavelet Decomposition, which overcomes the limitation
of Fourier transform by providing both time and frequency information. It involves breaking down a signal into smaller wavelets—short waves localized in
3
both time and frequency. This allows for the analysis of non-stationary signals,
which exhibit changes in frequency content over time, as is often the case with
biomedical signals like EEG.



6 Building the Baseline Model
In this task, you need to build a baseline machine learning model using the
Fourier features extracted from the EEG signals as well as Zero Crossing Rate.
The purpose of the baseline model is to establish an initial performance metric,
which can be used as a reference for further improvement.



7 Building the Best Model
In this task, participants need to build the best performing model by experimenting with various advanced techniques to improve upon the baseline model
developed earlier. The focus will be on optimizing the feature set, tuning hyperparameters, and possibly using more sophisticated models beyond the baseline
SVM.




8 Interpretability of the Best Model
Explainability is crucial in healthcare applications to ensure trust, accountability, and actionable insights for medical professionals. It is not sufficient for models to achieve high accuracy; they must also provide transparency about their decision-making processes. This section focuses on understanding the model’s reliance on different EEG channels for each class prediction.


9 Denoising
In real-world applications, data collected from sensors or medical instruments,
such as EEG signals, are often noisy due to various factors like environmental
interference, hardware limitations, and motion artifacts. These imperfections in
the data can significantly degrade the performance of tasks, such as classification
and anomaly detection, by masking the underlying signal of interest. Therefore,
effective signal denoising is a critical step in preprocessing, ensuring that the
data used for analysis is as clean and representative as possible.

10 Generative Modeling Techniques for Synthetic
EEG Data
Modern generative algorithms have revolutionized the ability to generate realistic synthetic data. In the context of EEG signal processing, these models
can be employed to generate class-wise synthetic EEG signals that mimic the
statistical properties of real data. This synthetic data can be used to augment
training datasets, helping to improve the performance of models in downstream
tasks such as classification. By enabling the generation of diverse datasets, generative approaches provide an opportunity to address problems in a dataset and
enhance model robustness, ultimately improving generalization to unseen data.
In the biomedical domain, where annotated data is often scarce and expensive
to collect, generative modeling becomes crucial for overcoming data limitations
and advancing model development
